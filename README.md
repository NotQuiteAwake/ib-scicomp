# Cambridge IB Scientific Computing Exercises

This is a collection of work I did for IB Scientific Computing in the Natural
Sciences Tripos last year. The sessions go up in difficulty and involve the
following tasks:

1. Euclidean algorithm for GCD
2. Series expansion of sin(x)
3. Monte Carlo estimation of ln(2)
4. Bisection root-finding in polynomials
5. Planatary motion simulation
6. 1D collision simulation

The code is released under a MIT license. Not that these are particularly useful
to anyone anyway...
